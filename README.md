# IOT-climate_controller
An IOT device was built that would automatically turn on an A.C or a heater (any electrical appliance) whenever the set threshold temperature crosses.
Would also tell the room temperature and humidity in an android app.
The Climate Controller was built using Esp8266 Module and Arduino Uno.
